Once upon a time, I took a class where I had to write a game in Swing for my midterm. This repository is a result of that 16 hour nightmare.
If you have a choice, do not try making a simple game in Swing. Use libgdx instead or better yet, avoid Java all together. Compared to making Solitaire once 
in Visual Studio with Windows Forms, this was far more painful and endured far longer.

  As a fellow classmate said so eloquently:    
  Things that take less time than this test took:  
  Training my dog to use the toilet.  
  Waiting for George RR Martins next Game of Thrones book.  
  Serving time for Murder.  
  Explaining to my mother that not every clickable link on the internet is worth clicking.  
  Teaching pigs to fly.  
  Bullet wounds healing.  
  That is all.
